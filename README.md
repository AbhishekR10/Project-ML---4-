# Project-ML-4
Key Features:
Data Exploration: Dive into the Titanic dataset to understand passenger demographics, survival rates, and correlations between different variables.
Feature Engineering: Engineer new features and preprocess the data to improve model performance and interpretability.
Machine Learning Models: Experiment with a variety of machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, to predict survival probabilities.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using cross-validation, ROC curves, confusion matrices, and other metrics to assess accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.
Predictive Analytics: Use trained models to predict survival outcomes for new or unseen passenger data, allowing for insights into historical survival patterns and potential passenger profiles.

Explore the code, notebooks, and visualizations to gain insights into the factors influencing Titanic survival and learn about machine learning techniques for predictive modeling. Whether you're a data science enthusiast, student, or Titanic history buff, this project offers valuable insights into the tragic events of the Titanic disaster and the factors that influenced passenger survival.
